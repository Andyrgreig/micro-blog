# Micro-Blog

This website was completed for The Odin Project's [Members Only](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-members-only) project. The goal was to build an "exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it."
